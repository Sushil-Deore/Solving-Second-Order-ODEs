# Solving-Second-Order-ODEs
To solve the Second Order Differential Equation (ODE). In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those function.

Newton’s Second Law: In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: 
F = ma

Example: The trajectory of a projectile launched from a cannon follows a curve determined by an ordinary differential equation that is derived from Newton's second law.
 
ODE: In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation(ODE) is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions.
